# Coraza Kubernetes Operator

[Web Application Firewall (WAF)] support for [Kubernetes] [Gateways].

## About

The Coraza Kubernetes Operator (CKO) enables declarative management of [Web
Application Firewalls (WAF)] on Kubernetes clusters. Users can deploy
firewall engines which are attached to gateways, and rules which those
engines enforce.

[CorazaWAF] is used as the firewall engine.

**Key Features:**

- `Engine` API - declaratively manage WAF instances
- `RuleSet` API - declaratively manage firewall rules
- [ModSecurity Seclang] compatibility

### Supported Integrations

The operator integrates with other tools to attach WAF instances to
their gateways/proxies:

- `istio` - Istio integration ✅ **Currently Supported (ingress Gateway only)**
- `wasm` - WebAssembly deployment ✅ **Currently Supported**

> **Note**: Only Istio+Wasm is supported currently.

### Architecture

The CKO's `RuleSetController` responds to `RuleSet` resources by validating and
compiling the rules, which gets emitted to a cache. The keys for the cache are
the namespace/name of the `RuleSet`, allowing the compiled set of rules to be
polled from a cache server hosting the cache.

> **Note**: Currently, only [Seclang] rules are supported.

The `EngineController` responds to `Engine` resources by deploying a WAF engine
according to the type and mode provided, and attaching it to a `Gateway`. It
targets a `RuleSet` to poll the compiled ruleset from the cache server and apply
it to the `Engine`. Poll intervals are set so the rules can be dynamically
updated over time.
